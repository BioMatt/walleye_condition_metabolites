## This repository contains scripts used in the manuscript "Morphology and Blood Metabolites Reflect Recent Spatial Differences Among Lake Winnipeg Walleye, *Sander vitreus*"
##### A repository for scripts used in statistical analyses of Lake Winnipeg walleye length-at-age over time and between sites, length-mass relationships over time and in 2017, and metabolites in 2017. 

### Within the R_scripts folder, there are four scripts and one data file:
  - `length-mass_over_time.R` contains code for reproducing analyses in the section *Lake Winnipeg Walleye Length-Mass Relationships*
  - `length_at_age_over_time.R` contains code for reproducing the section *Lake Winnipeg Walleye Length-at-Age Over Time*
  - `metabolite_differences.R` contains code for reproducing the section *Modeling Metabolite Differences*
  - `spatial_differences_2017.R` contains code for reproducing the section *Spatial Differences Among Walleye in 2017*
  - `select_metabolites.txt` is the raw data for the 9 metabolites used in the manuscript among *n*=39 fish, along with fork length and mass for each fish
